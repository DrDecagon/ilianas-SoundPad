# Iliana's Soundpad on Linux
- Linux setup for using a wireless numpad as a music / sound / dj pad
# -----------------------------------------
-
- This application allows you to use a standard external numpad as a dedicated and isolated input device for playing music or sounds, 
- while leaving the other inputs devices (like keyboard or media remote) free to control the OS normally.
-
- I use this to allow my kids to play music and sound effects I have pre-selected,
- at the volume I choose, while keeping them from messing up my media center.
-

-
-
- STANDARD INSTALLATION
-
- Download this repo -OR-
- git clone https://github.com/DrDecagon/ilianas-SoundPad.git
- open the newly created directory
- modify the 70-hotkey-pad.rules file to match your numpad's device IDs
- run ./installer.sh
-
- After installation, there should be a shortcut on the desktop named IlianaSP
- run this to set sound lists for a standard 17 button numpad.
- 
- You may have to manually modify the $HOME/KeypadSB/soundpad.sh file to use your model of numpad, the following lines will need to be tweaked
- xinput --disable 'keyboard:2.4G Mouse'
- actkbd -D -q -c $HOME/KeypadSB/config/actkbd.conf -d /dev/input/by-id/usb-1ea7_2.4G_Mouse-event-kbd
-
- I plan to implement a selector for this in the installer at a later date

# ILIANA'S SOUNDPAD FOR LINUX

A collection of tools and scripts for using a standard wireless numpad as a music / sound / dj pad

This application allows you to use a standard external numpad as a dedicated and isolated input device for playing music or sounds, while leaving the other inputs devices (like keyboard or media remote) free to control the OS normally.

I use this to allow my kids to play music and sound effects I have pre-selected, at the volume I choose, while keeping them from messing up my media center.  This could be used to play sound effects transitions while streaming and recording, or even as a cheap DJ Launchpad.



## Standard Installation (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint)

* sudo apt install git
* git clone https://github.com/DrDecagon/ilianas-SoundPad.git
* cd ilianas-soundpad
* sh install.sh

After installation, there should be a shortcut on the desktop named Iliana's SP Playlist Tool. Run this to set sound lists for the numpad.

You may have to manually modify /etc/udev/rules.d/70-hotkey-pad.rules to include your device ID.

You may have to manually modify the $HOME/KeypadSB/soundpad.sh file to use your model of numpad. The following lines will need to be tweaked:
  * xinput --disable 'keyboard:2.4G Mouse'
  * actkbd -D -q -c $HOME/KeypadSB/config/actkbd.conf -d /dev/input/by-id/usb-1ea7_2.4G_Mouse-event-kbd

(I plan to implement a selector for these last 2 steps in the future.)



## Manual Installation (depreciated)

* Install the folowing dependancies: actkbd, mpv, socat, zenity
* Download the MInst.tar.xz release
* Extract the package
* modify the 70-hotkey-pad.rules file to match your numpad's device IDs and then copy it to /etc/udev/rules.d/
* add soundpad.sh to the list of startup applications (debian, ubuntu, etc) - OR -
  * run # crontab -e
  * then add "@reboot sh $HOME/Music/Keypad/soundpad.sh" without quotes

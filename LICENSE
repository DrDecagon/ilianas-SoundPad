Fair Use Notice

This application comes with sample audio clips which are for educational and 
demonstrational purposes only.

These audio samples may contain copyrighted material owned by a third party, 
the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner. 
Notwithstanding a copyright owner’s rights under the Copyright Act, Section 107 of 
the Copyright Act allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring 
permission from the rights holders, for purposes such as education, criticism, 
comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. These so-called 
“fair uses” are permitted even if the use of the work would otherwise be infringing.

If you wish to use copyrighted material available with this project for your own purposes 
that go beyond fair use, you must obtain permission from the copyright owner. 
We recommend that you seek the advice of legal counsel if you have any questions on this point.

If you believe that any content or postings on this site violates your intellectual 
property or other rights, please notify us by email at github@drdecagon.anonaddy.com.
